The genetic horizons are not the equivalent of the diagnostic horizons of <i>Soil Taxonomy</i>. While designations of genetic horizons express a qualitative judgment about the kinds of changes that are believed to have taken place in a soil, diagnostic horizons are quantitatively defined features that are used to differentiate between taxa. A diagnostic horizon may encompass several genetic horizons, and the changes implied by genetic horizon designations may not be large enough to justify recognition of different diagnostic horizons. 
</br>--------------------------
</br>Soil pH
</br>. Extractable acid is used to calculate the cation-exchange capacity by the sum of cations method (CEC-8.2) and is also used as an option in the required characteristics of the natric horizon.<i>Extractable aluminum</i> is the amount of aluminum extracted by 1N KCl. It is considered exchangeable and a measure of the “active” acidity present in soils with a 1:1 water pH ≤5.5. Extractable aluminum is measured at KSSL by atomic absorption. Many laboratories measure the aluminum by titration with a base to the phenolphthalein end point. Titration measures exchangeable acidity as well as extractable aluminum. Soils with a pH below 4.0 or 4.5 are likely to have values determined by atomic absorption similar to values determined by titration because very little hydrogen is typically on the exchange complex. If there is a large percentage of organic matter, however, some hydrogen may be present. For some soils it is important to know which procedure was used. Extractable aluminum is reported as cmol(+)/kg-1 soil. It is used to calculate ECEC and in the criteria for Alic and some Eutric subgroups of Andisols. <i>Sum of extractable bases </i>is the sum of the basic cations calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium that are extracted with ammonium acetate buffered at pH 7. The bases are extracted from the cation-exchange complex by displacement with ammonium ions. They are equilibrated, filtered in an auto-extractor, and measured by atomic absorption. The individual cations and the sum of cations are reported as cmol(+)/kg-1 soil. The term “extractable bases” is used instead of “exchangeable bases” because soluble salts and some bases from carbonates can be included in the extract.<i>Exchangeable magnesium plus sodium and calcium plus </i><i>extractable acidity (at pH 8.2)</i> is used as a criterion for the natric horizon and Albic subgroups of Natraqualfs. The extractable acidity is measured at pH 8.2, and the magnesium, sodium, and calcium are extracted at pH 7.0 with ammonium acetate. See the paragraphs above on extractable acidity and extractable bases.<i>Base saturation</i> is reported on the data sheets as the percentage of the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) occupied by the four basic cations described above. It is reported in KSSL data by two methods: sum of cations at pH 8.2 and ammonium acetate at pH 7. Base saturation by ammonium acetate is equal to the sum of extractable bases, divided by the CEC by ammonium acetate (CEC-7), and multiplied by 100. If calcium carbonate or gypsum are present in a sample, then the extractable calcium may contain calcium from these minerals and the base saturation is assumed to be 100 percent. Base saturation by sum of cations is equal to the sum of bases extracted by ammonium acetate, divided by the CEC by sum of cations (CEC-8.2), and multiplied by 100. This value is not reported if either extractable calcium or extractable acidity is omitted. Differences between the two methods of determining base saturation reflect the amount of the pH-dependent CEC. Class definitions in this taxonomy specify which method is used.The sum of exchangeable cations is considered equal to the sum of bases extracted by ammonium acetate unless carbonates, gypsum, or other salts are present. When these salts are present, the sum of the bases extracted by ammonium acetate typically exceeds 100 percent of the CEC. Therefore, a base saturation of 100 percent is assumed. The amount of calcium from carbonates is usually much larger than the amount of magnesium from the carbonates. Extractable calcium is shown on KSSL datasheets even if carbonates (reported as calcium carbonate) are present. The base saturation (by CEC-7) is set to 100 percent if significant amounts of carbonates or gypsum are present. Base saturation by ammonium acetate is used in this taxonomy in the required characteristics for the mollic and umbric epipedons, the key to soil orders (Mollisols), and many great groups (e.g., Eutrudepts) and subgroups (e.g., Eutric Haplocryalfs) in several orders. Base saturation by sum of cations is used in the key to soil orders to identify Ultisols and in several Alfic, Dystric, and Ultic subgroups of Alfisols, Andisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Spodosols (e.g., Alfic Fragiorthods).
